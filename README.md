## About

The main focus of Fruitful Fun is to expand the farming aspect of the game and provide players with
more in-depth and impressive experiences. In this mod you will be able to unlock many fruitful items
by exploring the world and improving your farming skills.

## New Fruit Trees

Fruitful Fun adds 10 new fruits to the game. Most of the fruits are not generated in the world. Instead,
you must obtain them in other fun ways. If there is no people to harvest the fruits, the tree will stop
growing fruit after a while. But with the help of a special goat horn, you can harvest all the nearby
fruits at once.

## Pollination and Crossbreeding

If a bee pollinates different types of trees or flowers, it can probably produce some interesting effects.
By pollinating some specific blocks, you can get new fruit saplings that are more nutritious and valuable.

## Beekeeping and Genetics

Bees now have different traits and they basically inherit according to Mendel's law. You can unlock some
new perks and looks, and even be able to ride on a flying bee. In each new world, the genes will have a random
code, so you will have to guess their effects each time. Here provides a mutagen, using it on parents can
let you influence the genes of their baby a little bit. (Jade mod is highly recommended for viewing genetic
and pollination information.)

## Fruit-themed Foods

Several new placeable foods have been added to the game. We hope to introduce a diverse food culture from
around the world. The Farmer's Delight integration will also be enabled if you have the mod installed.
